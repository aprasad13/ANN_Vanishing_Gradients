# ANN_Vanishing_Gradients
This notebook simulates how gradients in Deep Neural Network vanishes. This can lead to loss of past information.

In this notebook I have used sigmoid function as an activation function for the simulation.

Click on [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/aprasad13/ANN_Vanishing_Gradients/blob/master/Vanishing_Gradients.ipynb) for a detailed code, description and visualizations.
